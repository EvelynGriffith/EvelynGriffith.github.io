### Notebook for my Senior Thesis at Allegheny College!

#### Post #1

Hello and Welcome to my research blog,
My name is Evelyn, and I am a Junior at Allegheny College. I am a double major in Computer Science and English(Emphasis in Creative Writing). A fun fact about me is that I am an Opera singer, trained for performance since I was 10, and I recently performed a Junior recital which was ten pieces long and spanned four different languages: English, French, Italian, and German!

I am hoping to start doing research in Artificial Intelligence, and specifically the study of Artificial Intelligence and how it can begin to predict human behaviors. Please continue reading the second post for more information regarding my specific idea!

My original idea for my research was to write a domain specific language that I could then incorporate as a communication device for a character in a young adult or middle grade novel. This idea was complicated because I wasn't sure how I would be able to incorporate the language in a way that still played into the interests of my audience, as well as the plot and style of the written story. I was also concerned that there would be no way to express how the language worked within the novel, and therefore having it in the novel would be rendered obsolete.

It is because of these reasons that I changed the idea in order to better adjust to the audience for which I am hoping to write. My alteration to my idea, is that I now want to create an AI program that allows me to predict character behaviors. This would hopefully be used as a character development tool for writers, and would be used in my novel in order to predict my own character’s behaviors.

One of the main questions I had about this idea, however, is how would the code for this idea be able to be proven? If I were to write the character’s personality traits, as well as the code, then the computer wouldn’t have any outside sources to test against. It is because of this that I have decided to start my research with a survey for English Students at Allegheny College. What I will do, is I will find a book that the majority of students have read (such as Jane Eyre, or Pride and Prejudice – something that a lot of people had to read for high school),and from there I will ask students how they predict a character would react if placed in a situation that is not in the context of their novel. It must be noted that these questions should still be in the time and cultural context of the novel, or else there could be confusion for the survey takers. For example, I might ask the question: “Would Jane Eyre ever decide to spend all of her money on clothing? The answer, based on knowing who Jane Eyre is as a person, is that she is frugal and therefore would not spend her money on something like that.

What I will achieve by giving these surveys is that I can then cross-reference whether or not the program is making decisions that humans would make. From here I would write the basic profile for a character in a novella or short story that I would like to write, and I would ask the program what it thinks the character would do if asked to do something. From there, I would write what the program says the character should do and attempt to add human artistic vision to this basic decision that the computer has made.

Hopefully, in the end, this project can be a way of expressing how humans and AI can be used TOGETHER to create art, and that art is human, but that it can be influenced and helped by computational means.
