### Notebook for my Senior Thesis at Allegheny College!

#### Post #1

- My original idea for my research was to write a domain specific language that I could then encorporate as a communication device for a character in a young adult or middle grade novel. This idea was complex, and I wasn't sure how I would be able to encorporate the language in a way that still played into the interests of my audience. I was also concerned that there would be no way to express how the language worked within the novel, so I changed the idea slightly in order to better adjust for these concerns.
