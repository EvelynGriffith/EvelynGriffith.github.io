#### Educational Background

I﻿ am currently pursuing a Computer Science and English (Creative Writing) double major at Allegheny College in Meadville Pennsylvania.

#### W﻿hy I've Chosen to Pursue Computer Science and English

I am hoping to pursue graduate school opportunities in Computer Science, English (Creative Writing), or something that combines the two. I am particularly interested in graduate schools that research Computational Narrative and the facilitation of human connection through Computational Art. When I’m not working on my Computational and Literary pursuits, I am actively involved with the Allegheny Music Department where I participate in Women’s Ensemble, College Choir, Voice Lessons, and Opera Scenes. I am also a Junior Editor of the Allegheny Review as well as a devoted member and Leader of Allegheny Christian Outreach. I work currently as a Choral Librarian/Manager for the Allegheny Choirs as well as a Writing Consultant on campus.

Fun Fact: I recently performed a full Junior Recital where I sang 10 pieces in four different languages: French, German, Italian, and English.
