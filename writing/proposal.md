# Informative Title for the Project

Allegheny Role-Play and Gaming Organization (ARGO) Website

## Pallas Cain and Evelyn Griffith

## Description of the Main Idea

We plan to program our own website using multiple coding languages including but not limited to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website will have a fantasy theme for the board game club on campus, ARGO. We would like to include a variety of functionalities such as a fantasy name generator and multiple tabs to our website. This website will have all the resources a student would need to get in contact with ARGO and or get started with their own campaign. It could also be linked to ARGO's pdf library. If we have time we would like to include a photo library.

## Description of the Tasks that You Will Complete

This project falls under the Student-Designed Project that uses a combination of coding languages.

Tasks that need to get done is the basic UI with the separate tabs.
The random name generator will probably be made using Python and the `random` package.
We will also have to implement a way to connect the items in the ARGO google Drive to the website for students to use.
We will also have to import photos from the ARGO Instagram account to create the photo gallery.
